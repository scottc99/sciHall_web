# sciHall_web
The framework for the web page designed to combine the clubs in Rowan University's Science Hall

Individually, each of the science clubs at Rowan University strive to both get people excited about their respective fields
while simultaneously reaching out to fellow peers sharing the same interests. 

With 6 total clubs, and a rapidly expanding university, our main focus is to enhance collaboration among current students, as
well as ease the transition for the incoming students each year.
